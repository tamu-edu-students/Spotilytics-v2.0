# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR 0001 – Use Spotify API as the primary Source (No DB)
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**  
Spotilytics retrieves real-time Spotify data. Storing a local copy adds complexity and compliance risk without long-term benefit.

**Decision**  
Do not maintain an internal database. Fetch data directly from Spotify APIs and cache short-lived results only.

**Consequences**  
- Advantage: Always fresh and consistent data  
- Downside: Dependent on Spotify API uptime and latency  
- Downside: Must respect API rate limits

## ADR 0002 – Authentication via Spotify OAuth
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**  
Users must log in securely and authorize Spotilytics to access their profile, top tracks and artists.

**Decision**  
Implement Spotify OAuth 2.0 using `omniauth` and `rspotify`. Tokens are stored in session only; refresh handled by RSpotify.

**Consequences**  
- Advantage: Secure, proven flow  
- Advantage: Spotify-compliant token management  
- Downside: Relies on RSpotify library abstractions  
- Downside: Must handle expired sessions gracefully

## ADR 0003 – Short-Lived Caching in Memory/Session
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**  
Frequent Spotify API calls could slow page loads and hit rate limits.

**Decision**  
Cache lightweight API responses (e.g. top artists/tracks) in session or memory for minutes; invalidate via “Refresh Data”.

**Consequences**  
- Advantage: Faster user experience  
- Advantage: Fewer external API calls  
- Downside: Cache lost on dyno restart  
- Downside: Potential stale data if not refreshed

## ADR 0004 – Server-Side Playlist Creation
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**  
Creating playlists requires user tokens. Executing this client-side would expose credentials.

**Decision**  
Handle playlist creation entirely server-side within `PlaylistsController#create`.

**Consequences**  
- Advantage: Secure and auditable  
- Advantage: Simplifies frontend logic  
- Downside: Adds load to server-side  
- Downside: Must throttle to avoid hitting Spotify limits

## ADR 005 – Add “Refresh Data” Action for Live Spotify Sync
**Status:** Accepted

**Context**  
Spotilytics visualizes listening data (top tracks, artists, genres and recommendations) directly from Spotify’s Web API and stores it in the cache for several hours.  
Users often want to see their most recent stats — especially after major playlist updates or new songs played.  
We needed a lightweight mechanism to force re-fetching from the API without manual cache clearing or session resets.

**Decision**  
Add a **“Refresh Data”** button in the navigation bar that triggers a refresh of cached Spotify data.  
When clicked, it clears temporary session-level caches and re-requests data from Spotify APIs for:  
- Top tracks  
- Top artists  
- Recommendations  

**Consequences**  
- Advantage: Enables real-time Spotify data sync on demand  
- Advantage: Improves user trust and transparency (“instant refresh”)  
- Advantage: Avoids the need for background jobs or a persistent DB  
- Downside: Increases API traffic if users refresh too frequently  
- Downside: Adds minor latency (API round-trip before page render)

# Postmortem: 

## Incident 001 – Limited User Data for Inactive Spotify Accounts

Date: 2025-28-10
Status: Closed

### Impact

Users with low Spotify activity (e.g. few streams in the past year) saw empty or incomplete data visualizations on the Dashboard and Top Tracks/Artists pages. This led to poor user experience and confusion about whether the app was broken.

### Root Cause

Spotify’s “Top Items” endpoints return limited results when a user’s listening history is insufficient. Spotilytics didn’t account for this edge case in early builds.

### Actions Taken
- Added empty state UI (“Not enough data yet — start listening and come back!”).
- Adjusted analytics logic to gracefully render placeholders when fewer than 5 tracks or artists are returned.

### Follow-Up
- Consider hybrid display using Spotify featured playlists as filler data to enhance UI.

## Incident 002 – Follow/Unfollow Rate Limit Exceeded

Date: 2025-02-11
Status: Closed

### Impact

Frequent follow/unfollow actions in the Top Artists tab triggered Spotify API’s 429 Too Many Requests rate limit, causing temporary errors and failed interactions.

### Root Cause

The Spotify Web API enforces per-user and per-app rate limits. The UI allowed rapid toggling of follow state without throttling or batching requests.

### Actions Taken
- Batched multiple API calls server-side using short async queues.

### Follow-Up
- Evaluate caching artist follow state locally to reduce duplicate calls.
- Track API usage metrics in logs to identify peak load.

## Incident 003 – Restricted Access in Spotify Developer “Development Mode”

Date: 2025-25-10
Status: Ongoing (Known Limitation)

### Impact

New users not whitelisted in the Spotify Developer Dashboard couldn’t log in to Spotilytics, receiving “You are not registered for this app” errors.
This limited testing to a small group of manually added accounts.

### Root Cause

Spotify Developer apps in Development Mode only allow 25 registered testers.
Upgrading to “Production Mode” requires Spotify approval and organizational verification.

### Actions Taken
- Documented the testing limitation clearly in README.
- Added instructions for adding testers via Developer Dashboard.

### Follow-Up
- Move Spotilytics app to Spotify Verified Org once org-level upgrade is requested from Spotify.
- Add fallback “Demo Mode” (mock data) for public users to explore app features without Spotify login.

## Incident 004 – Coverage Reports Not Merging in CI

Date: 2025-03-11
Status: Resolved

### Impact

GitHub Actions showed 0% line coverage for Cucumber tests even though all scenarios passed locally.
This created confusion and reduced visibility into real test health.

### Root Cause

SimpleCov for Cucumber was writing to the default coverage/ folder, while RSpec wrote to coverage/rspec/.
CI didn’t collate both result sets before report upload.

### Actions Taken
- Updated features/support/env.rb to set:
```bash
    SimpleCov.command_name 'Cucumber'
    SimpleCov.coverage_dir 'coverage/cucumber'
```

- Updated CI workflow to run:
```bash
    bundle exec ruby bin/coverage_merge
```

- Verified merged report includes both RSpec and Cucumber.

# Debug Pointers

This section provides **useful context for developers** trying to debug issues in the codebase — including fixes that worked, workarounds that were tested and common dead ends to avoid.

| Issue / Area | Tried Solutions | Final Working Fix / Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
|Spotify OAuth login failing (“invalid_client” or “redirect_uri_mismatch”)| Tried re-authenticating and restarting server — didn’t help. | Added the exact callback URLs (/auth/spotify/callback) for both localhost and Heroku to the Spotify Developer Dashboard and verified SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET were set in GitHub Actions and Heroku config vars. Also ensured that the user was whitelisted in development mode |
| Empty dashboard for inactive Spotify users | Tried switching to long_term time range only - data still missing. | Added friendly empty-state messages when Spotify returns insufficient top tracks/artists. |
| Playlist creation failing with “Invalid time range” | Tried re-sending POST requests from UI — no success. | Ensured time_range parameter matches one of the valid keys: short_term, medium_term, long_term. |
| Recommendations tab returning no results | Verified API keys — still empty. | Confirmed the app had user-top-read and user-read-recently-played scopes enabled in Spotify Developer Dashboard |
| Top Tracks limits not persisting across columns | Only the changed column updated — others reset to default. | Preserved other range limits via hidden fields (limit_short_term, limit_medium_term, limit_long_term) in the form before submission.|

---

# Debugging Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| OAuth callback fails on Heroku | Missing redirect URI or wrong environment variables | Add exact production callback to Spotify Developer Dashboard and check SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID / SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET in Heroku/ Github config|
| “You are not registered for this app” during login / Login works locally but not in production
 | Spotify app still in Development Mode | Add test users under User Management in Spotify Dashboard or request Production access |
| Follow/Unfollow buttons randomly fail | Rate limit hit | Batch or throttle API requests; respect Spotify’s rate limits; avoid repeated clicks |
